                        Limit one (1) entry per person, per email address, and per household for the duration
                        of the Sweepstakes Period, regardless of method of entry. Entries received from any
                        person, e-mail address, or household in excess of the stated limitation will be void. All
                        entries become the property of Sponsor and will not be acknowledged or returned.

                        <h4>6. PrizeDrawing</h4>
                        <p>
                        On or about December 27, 2016, the Sponsor will select potential winners in a
                        random drawing from among all eligible entries received. The odds of being selected
                        depend on the number of entries received. The Sponsor will attempt to notify the
                        potential winner via telephone or email on or about December 28, 2016. If the
                        potential winner cannot be contacted within five (5) days after the date of the first
                        attempt to contact him/her, the Sponsor may select an alternate potential winner in
                        his/her place at random from the remaining non-winning, eligible entries.
                        </p>
                        <h4>7. Winner Notification</h4>
                        <p>
                        The potential winners will be notified by email, mail or phone. Each potential Grand
                        and First Prize winner (parent/legal guardian if a minor in his/her state of residence) will
                        be required to complete, electronically sign and submit a Declaration of Compliance
                        within five (5) days of the date notice or attempted notice is sent, in order to claim
                        his/her prize. If a potential winner cannot be contacted, or fails to submit the
                        Declaration of Compliance within the required time period (if applicable), or prize is
                        returned as undeliverable, potential winner forfeits prize. If the potential winner is at
                        least 18 but still considered a minor in his/her jurisdiction of residence, Sponsor
                        reserves the right to award the prize in the name of his/her parent or legal guardian,
                        who will be required to sign the Declaration of Compliance on the potential winners
                        behalf and fulfill any other requirements imposed on winner set forth herein. Potential
                        winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules,
                        and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements. In the event that a potential
                        winner is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor will award the applicable prize to an
                        alternate winner by random drawing from among all remaining eligible entries. Only
                        three (3) alternate drawings will be held, after which the prize will remain un-awarded.
                        Prizes will be fulfilled approximately 8-10 weeks after the conclusion of the
                        Sweepstakes.

                        Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, either (a)
                        suspend the Sweepstakes to address the impairment and then resume the
                        Sweepstakes in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Official Rules or (
                        terminate the Sweepstakes and, in the event of termination, award the prize at random
                        from among the eligible, non-suspect entries received up to the time of the impairment.
                        The Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds

                        such an attempt be made, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages (including
                        attorney's fees) and any other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent
                        permitted by law. Failure by the Sponsor to enforce any provision of these Official
                        Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
                       </p>
