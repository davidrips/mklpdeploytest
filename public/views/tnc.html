                    <p>
                    Participation in the Sweepstakes constitutes entrant's full and unconditional agreement
                    to and acceptance of these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor, which are
                    final and binding. Winning a prize is contingent upon being compliant with these Official
                    Rules and fulfilling all other requirements set forth herein.
                    </p>
                    <h4>4. Sweepstakes Period</h4>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <h4>5. How to Enter</h4>
                    <p>
                    Limit one (1) entry per person, per email address, and per household for the duration
                    of the Sweepstakes Period, regardless of method of entry. Entries received from any
                    person, e-mail address, or household in excess of the stated limitation will be void. All
                    entries become the property of Sponsor and will not be acknowledged or returned.
                    </p>
                    <h4>6. PrizeDrawing</h4>
                    <p>
                    On or about December 27, 2016, the Sponsor will select potential winners in a
                    random drawing from among all eligible entries received. The odds of being selected
                    depend on the number of entries received. The Sponsor will attempt to notify the
                    potential winner via telephone or email on or about December 28, 2016. If the
                    potential winner cannot be contacted within five (5) days after the date of the first
                    attempt to contact him/her, the Sponsor may select an alternate potential winner in
                    his/her place at random from the remaining non-winning, eligible entries.
                    </p>
                    <h4>7. Winner Notification</h4>
                    <p>
                    The potential winners will be notified by email, mail or phone. Each potential Grand
                    and First Prize winner (parent/legal guardian if a minor in his/her state of residence) will
                    be required to complete, electronically sign and submit a Declaration of Compliance
                    within five (5) days of the date notice or attempted notice is sent, in order to claim
                    his/her prize. If a potential winner cannot be contacted, or fails to submit the
                    Declaration of Compliance within the required time period (if applicable), or prize is
                    returned as undeliverable, potential winner forfeits prize. If the potential winner is at
                    least 18 but still considered a minor in his/her jurisdiction of residence, Sponsor
                    reserves the right to award the prize in the name of his/her parent or legal guardian,
                    who will be required to sign the Declaration of Compliance on the potential winners
                    behalf and fulfill any other requirements imposed on winner set forth herein. Potential
                    winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules,
                    and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements. In the event that a potential
                    winner is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor will award the applicable prize to an
                    alternate winner by random drawing from among all remaining eligible entries. Only
                    three (3) alternate drawings will be held, after which the prize will remain un-awarded.
                    Prizes will be fulfilled approximately 8-10 weeks after the conclusion of the
                    Sweepstakes.

                   <p>
                    In the event that the operation, security, or administration of the Sweepstakes is

                    worm, unauthorized human intervention or other technical problem, or in the event the
                    Sweepstakes is unable to run as planned for any other reason, as determined by
                    Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, either (a)
                    suspend the Sweepstakes to address the impairment and then resume the
                    Sweepstakes in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Official Rules or (
                    terminate the Sweepstakes and, in the event of termination, award the prize at random
                    from among the eligible, non-suspect entries received up to the time of the impairment.
                    The Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds
                    to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes or to be
                    acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner.
                    Any attempt by any person to damage the website or undermine the legitimate
                    operation of the Sweepstakes may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should
                    such an attempt be made, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages (including
                    attorney's fees) and any other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent
                    permitted by law. Failure by the Sponsor to enforce any provision of these Official
                    Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
                   </p>
